Welcome to my personal site! Here you can find my [CV](https://trademark17.github.io/cv), my [publication](https://trademark17.github.io/publications), [movies](https://trademark17.github.io/movies) made by other people, and [music](https://trademark17.github.io/music) made by me.

------

Art and science should be free and accessible to all.
1. My publication is open access, and its code and data are freely available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TradeMark17/).
1. The [movies](https://trademark17.github.io/movies) tab of this site has links to Google Drives containing movies I enjoy.
1. The [music](https://trademark17.github.io/music) tab of this site has a link to a Google Drive containing _drafts_ of songs I've made and a list of their samples.

If any of my own work interests you, feel free to use it for your own projects. I'd be happy to provide additional resources; just reach out to me via email.
