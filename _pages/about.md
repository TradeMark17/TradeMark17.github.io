Welcome to my personal site! Here you can find my [CV](https://trademark17.github.io/cv/), my [publication](https://trademark17.github.io/publications/), [movies](https://trademark17.github.io/movies/) made by other people, and [music](https://trademark17.github.io/music/) made by me.

### Art and science should be [free](https://fmhy.net/beginners-guide/) and accessible to all.


My [publication](https://trademark17.github.io/publications/) is open access, and its code and data are freely available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/TradeMark17/).

To spite the predatorial film industry and the authoritarian inundation of subscription services in our daily lives, it is a hobby of mine to download movies I enjoy. You can access my small but growing collection in the [movies](https://trademark17.github.io/movies/) tab.

The [music](https://trademark17.github.io/music/) tab contains _drafts_ of songs I've made and a list of their samples.

If any of my work interests you, feel free to use it for your own projects. I'd be happy to provide additional resources; just reach out to me via email.
